### Local

phant is a [npm](https://www.npmjs.org) package, and requires the latest version of [node.js](http://nodejs.org).

Once you have node.js installed, you can install phant by running `npm install -g phant` from your favorite terminal.
Using the `-g` (global) flag will make the `phant` executable available in your `PATH`.

Now you can start phant:

```bash
$ phant
phant http server running on port 8080
phant telnet server running on port 8081
```

This launches a [telnet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet) server for stream creation, and a http server for data input & output.
You can now open a separate window, and you should be able to create a stream by connecting to the local telnet server.

```
$ telnet localhost 8081
Trying 127.0.0.1...
